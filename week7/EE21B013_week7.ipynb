    "### 1. function find_min :\n",
    "- For finding minima i made the function find_min :\n",
    "    - It will take input parameter as :\n",
    "        - func : the function over which annealing will be applied to find minima\n",
    "        - bestx : starting point to start\n",
    "        - decayrate : decay rate for applying annelaing \n",
    "        - tempearature\n",
    "        - the range of search space is defined inside the function as it is not given in the problem statement to take the range as input that's why i have defined the search space inside the function only.\n",
    "        - there is nothing much to say about the code as it is same as it is given in the presentation file of the problem statement i have just encapsulated it inside the function.\n",
    "        - The function return bestx and bestcost till the no of iteration defined found using annealing concept.\n",
    "### 2. Function read_file :\n",
    "- This function i made for reading a file and return the data inside the file in form of list.\n",
    "### 3. Function find_min_cost_tsp : \n",
    "- For solving the travelling salesman problem I made this function \n",
    "    - Input parameters : \n",
    "        - only the file name in which the **x** and **y** coordinates of the cities are given \n",
    "        - It will read the datafile using the readfile method defined before and  store the data accrodingly.\n",
